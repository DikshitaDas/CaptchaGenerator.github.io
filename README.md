# Captcha Generator

This project creates a simple Captcha generator and validator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is used to ensure that the input is generated by a human and not a computer program.

## Overview

The Captcha Generator project consists of an HTML interface where users are presented with a randomly generated Captcha code. The user must enter the exact code to validate it. If the entered code matches the generated Captcha, a "Matched" message appears; otherwise, a "Not-Matched" message is displayed.

## Features

- **Random Captcha Generation:** Generates a random alphanumeric Captcha code of fixed length (default 6 characters).
- **Validation:** Validates user input against the generated Captcha code.
- **Refresh:** Allows users to generate a new Captcha code if they find it difficult to read or wish to refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling and appearance of the elements.
- **JavaScript:** Captcha generation, input validation, and event handling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DikshitaDas/CaptchaGenerator.git
   cd CaptchaGenerator
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

   Open the `index.html` file using your preferred web browser. You should see the Captcha Generator interface.

3. **Usage:**

   - **Generate Captcha:** Upon loading, a Captcha code will be generated automatically.
   - **Enter Captcha:** Enter the code shown in the input field labeled "Enter the Captcha!!".
   - **Submit:** Click the "Submit" button to check if your input matches the generated Captcha.
   - **Refresh:** Click the "Refresh" button to generate a new Captcha code if needed.

## Styling

The project uses CSS for styling, including:
- Gradient background color animation.
- Centered and styled buttons for submit and refresh actions.
- Input fields styled for clarity and ease of use.

## Future Enhancements

- **Accessibility:** Improve accessibility features such as adding alt text for images and improving keyboard navigation.
- **Security:** Implement additional security measures to prevent automated scripts from bypassing the Captcha.
- **Customization:** Allow users to customize the length and complexity of the Captcha code.
